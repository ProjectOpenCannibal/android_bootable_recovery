        <h5>Making your Site Public</h5>
        DNS Servers are a tricky business. Here at GitManagement, we handle everything related to customers domain's DNS records for FREE. Yes, for free, with the
        reliability of Windows DNS Server 2012, you won't have to worry about being outdated. We will handle everything from pointing an A record, to getting your mail
        server up and running. For more info

    <li class="three">
        <h5>Getting Your Mail Server Running</h5>
        It's not recommended to use an external mail server such as Google Apps or Windows Live Domains for your business mail. You need a high-quality, low maintenance mail
        server that you won't have to worry about crashing, or stalling your mail flow. Here at GitManagement, we will provide your users with access to MDaemon, a high quality
        mail server, best suited for production use for just US $4.95 more each month.

        With our mail servers having 100% uptime, and our web servers having a 84.6% uptime rate, we ARE the true meaning of consistent servers. 
        We never will have downtime without providing subscribers with a thirty-day advance notice, and if we have an unexpected interruption in service, we will reimburse subscribers
        for the downtime they experienced either by an account credit, or a service upgrade. Click here to
